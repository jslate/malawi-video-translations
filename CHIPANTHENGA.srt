<b>I am Chipanthenga and I am a village headman.</b>

2
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:10,916
<b>I'm speaking about water issues as we are at the river.</b>

3
01:00:11,625 --> 01:00:23,041
<b>I am surounded by four villages, namely, </b>
<b>Mayola, Julious, Amndinda, and Chiyani.</b>

4
01:00:23,333 --> 01:00:28,208
<b>We have been struggling with dirty water for a long time.</b>

5
01:00:30,291 --> 01:00:37,625
<b>We came from Lilongwe to settle in these villages</b>
<b>in Kasungu in 1976.</b>

6
01:00:38,541 --> 01:00:44,500
<b>The water challenges in my villages never end. We have</b>
<b>tried to raise our concerns for a long time.</b>

7
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:59,000
<b>Men from all the villages are still escorting their wives to</b>
<b>the river, protecting them from wild animals.</b>

8
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:11,666
<b>We are requesting help if possible. We are looking for</b>
<b>organizations that understand the problems we are facing.</b>

9
01:01:11,666 --> 01:01:25,916
<b>They have to help my community. The major problem in my</b>
<b>villages is safe water.</b>

10
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:36,208
<b>As we speak women are not sleeping because they are fetching</b>
<b>water.</b>

11
01:01:36,208 --> 01:01:41,291
<b>We have tried to reach out our counselor and our</b>
<b>Member of Parliment to explain our problems.</b>
